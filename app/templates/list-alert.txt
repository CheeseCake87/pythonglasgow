Hi All,

The next Python Glasgow event will be a Dojo! This will be happening a week
today and is kindly hosted by Twigs in their office near Charing Cross. It is
a free but ticketed event, so if you want to come along, make sure you get
a ticket before they run out! Currently we only have four left.

To claim yours, go to: http://pythonglasgow.eventwax.com/dojo-april-2013

If you missed the original email or want to find out more about what happens
at the dojo - look here: http://mail.python.org/pipermail/glasgow/2013-March/000023.html

Cheers,
Dougal
