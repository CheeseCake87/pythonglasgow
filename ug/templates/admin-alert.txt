Hi Python Glasgow Admin!

There is an event listed in the Python Glasgow calendar that is in {{ days }} days.

You need to;

- Book the venue.
OR
- Remove the event if its not happening.

If you don't do anything and the event is still in the calendar then a
notification email will be send out to the list in {{ diff }}.
The email that is going to be sent out is shown below.
