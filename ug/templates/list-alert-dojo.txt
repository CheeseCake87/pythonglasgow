Hi All,

The next Python Glasgow event will be a {{ event.title }}! In {{ days }}
days on the {{ event.date_string() }} at {{ event.where }}.

It is a free but ticketed event, so if you want to come along, make sure you
get a ticket before they run out!

{% if event.metadata['link'] %}
To claim yours, go to: {{ event.metadata['link'] }}
{% endif %}

If you missed the original email or want to find out more about what happens
at the dojo - look here: http://mail.python.org/pipermail/glasgow/2013-March/000023.html

Cheers,
Dougal
